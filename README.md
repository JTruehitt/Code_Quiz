# Module 4 Challenge: Code Quiz

## Description
In this challenge, I was tasked with building a multiple choice quiz that resembled the functionality of a given mockup. On start, the quiz will cycle through 5 questions, at the end of which the user can enter their name and post their score to the high scores list. The quiz is timed, and the timer/user score is docked with each incorrect answer. The high score list can be cleared by the user. 

This was a difficult challenge and really made me stretch my newly developed javascript skills. Throughout creating this application, I learned about the following topics:

- declaring global variables and linking document elements at the beginning of the script
- Created my first objects to store questions, choices, and answers
- Implemented setInterval and clearInterval
- Utilized multiple event listeners
- Used setTimeout to delay function call and set tempo of the quiz
- Dove deeper into DOM manipulation to create and hide elements as needed
- Utilized fluid CSS to provide a good experience regardless of device used

While the quiz is functional and meets all acceptance criteria as is, I would like to revisit this in the future to refactor the code to cut down on the redundant functions to move between questions and checking each answer individually. I know there are ways to iterate through this more efficiently, so once I have a few more projects under my belt and a bit more grasp of these concepts, this will get an overhaul.
